Instructions for using the Interior Daylight Starter scene:

This scene is set up to simulate bright sunlight, for use in rendering in an interior environment. The Global illumination and Ambient Occlusion have been adjusted for temporal data creation. Note that when photographing interiors while sunlight floods in through windows, the sun will mute the effect of interior lighting until the sun is very dim, i.e. at dawn or dusk. The Point and Spot lights in the scene serve as examples of interior luminaires, and provide a small accent to the sunlight.

Exposure notes:
The Exposure is set in the Post Processing Profile using Fixed mode at an EV 8. Additionally, the Main Camera Aperture and Shutter Speed are adjusted to allow switching to Physical Camera exposure mode.

Global Illumination:
In the Post Processing Profile, the Screen Space Global Illumination is enabled, and set to enhance the primary bounce contribution. If you are generating non-sequential imagery using the Perception tools, disable SSGI.

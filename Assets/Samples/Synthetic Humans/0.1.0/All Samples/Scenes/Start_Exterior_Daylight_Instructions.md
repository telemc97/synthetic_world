Instructions for using the Daylight Starter scene:

This scene is set up to simulate bright sunlight, for use in rendering in an outdoor environment. The Global Illumination and Ambient Occlusion have been adjusted for temporal data creation. When photographing exterior scenes in full daylight, the intensity of the sun will overpower any artificial lights in in the scene. 

Exposure notes:
The Exposure is set in the Post Processing Profile using Fixed mode at an EV 10. Additionally, the Main Camera Aperture and Shutter Speed are adjusted to allow switching to Physical Camera exposure mode.

Global Illumination:
In the Post Processing Profile, the Screen Space Global Illumination is enabled, and set to enhance the primary bounce contribution. If you are generating non-sequential imagery using the Perception tools, disable SSGI.
